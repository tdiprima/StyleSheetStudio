  <h1>Rindfleischetikettierungsüberwachungsaufgabenübertragungsgesetz</h1>
  <p>The word - which refers to the "law for the delegation of monitoring beef labelling", has been repealed by a
    regional parliament after the EU lifted a recommendation to carry out BSE tests on healthy cattle.
    German is famous for its compound nouns, which frequently become so cumbersome they have to be reduced to
    abbreviations. The beef labelling law, introduced in 1999 to protect consumers from BSE, was commonly transcribed as
    the "RkReÜAÜG", but even everyday words are shortened to initials so Lastkraftwagen - lorry - becomes Lkw.</p>
