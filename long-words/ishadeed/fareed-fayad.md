ishadeed.com.html has a nice stylesheet.

It contains links to other known articles.

I got the idea from [this article](https://ishadeed.com/article/css-short-long-content/).

There's no code.  So I went looking all over the place.

[This page](https://ishadeed.com/article/min-max-css/) has a bunch of codepens.

I scraped the page for all the codepen hyperlinks, and put code in the code folder.

The End.

Love, Bear
